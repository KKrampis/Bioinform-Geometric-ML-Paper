Neurons that do arithmetic.

Let us now see how the biological structure of the neuron, can be represented by a simple computational unit that can be utilized as component of artificial neural netwoks.This representation (Fig. ) was published by Warren McCullogh and Waren Pitts in 19xx,[], and Marvin Minsky has explored its applications in detail ([],[]). As we can see from the picture the McCullogh_Pitts "neuron" is represented and a circle, where the left half has the number that represents the threshold that needs to be met for the neuron to be acctivated, and the right half carries the signal of the active neuron.The arrows entering from the left are the "fibers" or axons (to use the biological analogy), which bring in signals from the neighbooring neurons. There is no restriction on how many signals can come from others neurons on the right, but only one signal fiber can be transmitted on the left.Notice on Fig. that some of the incoming signal lines have a small circle instead of an arrow; these are inhibition fibers and once a signal is present in one of them, the neuron will not "fire" to the left whatever the other non inhibitory signals might be. An important thing to remember is that the input fibers as we will see in further detail in the next paragraphs, do not always carry a signal, since that depends on whether the prior neuron where the fiber is coming from was activated or not.

So let us know see examples of the McCullogh Pitts neurons and computations they can perform...
